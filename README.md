# Make your github pretty

A project to allow anyone to customise their github activity/contributions graph with whatever they want.

Feel like adding some text? Sure

Feel like painting something onto it? Sure

Feel like uploading a picture and having a trashy pixel art version of it on your contributions history? Weird flex but ok

...Currently in development, will update here when all is said and done.

To run it locally:
```
yarn
yarn start
```
